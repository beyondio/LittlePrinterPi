# LittlePrinterPi

### Description
Multiple ways to set up a Raspberry Pi that includes a working installation of [Sirius](https://github.com/genmon/sirius), the alternative backend / cloud component for your BERG Cloud Little Printer.

### Installing a barebones Sirius on a Raspberry Pi

#### Options
You can either:

1. Install the [pre-made image](https://github.com/beyondio/LittlePrinterPi/wiki/Image): pick this if you just want start printing again.  At the moment you can log in with Twitter and send messages to your Little Printer.
2. Use [the install script](https://github.com/beyondio/LittlePrinterPi/wiki/script): pick this if you want a working Sirius installation which you can use to further explore and develop Sirius. The script sets up a virtualenv which makes it easier to work in.
3. [Explore the script](https://github.com/beyondio/LittlePrinterPi/blob/master/LittlePrinterPi.sh) and manually follow all the steps.  Use this if you know what you're doing or want to set up something specific.  The install script should work -caveat emptor- on any debian based linux distribution, but you will have to install the appropriate PhantomJS as described [here](https://gist.github.com/hako/f8944cfa7b8fb8115f6d#installing-phantomjs).
